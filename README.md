# static-webpage-using-bootstrap
Another static webpage (incase you've checked my [Previous git repo](https://github.com/yuviwolvy/static-webpage)) but using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

For installation just clone the repository, and that's it, you don't have to install Bootstrap as I've used CDN Links.
